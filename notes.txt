convert image into 3 2d arrays
  red values
  green values
  blue values

run 3 separate DFT's

find out the actual ordering of bytes within bmp data
  pixel by pixel
  left to right, then bottom to top
  each ROW is a multiple of four bytes (padded)
  size of pixel is determined by bmp_header.pixelsize in bits.
    multiply by row size then pad up to a multiple of 4
  size of the entire data is bmp_header.bitmapsize

can conversion between [r/g/b][row * len, col]
  and [r/g/b][row][col]
  formats be done in parallel?
and then convert back.

free old data, then bmp.data = new_data

then write back

texture mem?
